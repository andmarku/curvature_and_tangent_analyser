torus_1: r = 3, R = 20	purpose is to show slim toruses (should have good values).
torus_2: r = 6, R = 8	purpose is to show thick toruses (problem in center with smoothing).
torus_3: r = 8, R = 16	purpose is to show a medium torus (ok response).

helix_1: r = 3, R = 6, h = 3, n = 1	purpose is to show that edges has a large (faulty) impact.
helix_2: r = 3, R = 10, h = 1.5, n = 3	purpose is to show that close fibres impact each other.
helix_3: r = 3, R = 10, h = 3, n = 3	purpose is to show less impact from both cases (best).
