torus_1: r = 3, R = 20	purpose is to show slim toruses (should have good values).
torus_2: r = 15, R = 20	purpose is to show thick toruses (problem in center with smoothing).
torus_3: r = 10, R = 20	purpose is to show a medium torus (ok response).

helix_1: r = 3, R = 10, h = 3, n = 1	purpose is to show that edges has a large (faulty) impact.
helix_2: r = 3, R = 10, h = 1.5, n = 3	purpose is to show that close fibres impact each other.
helix_3: r = 3, R = 10, h = 3, n = 3	purpose is to show less impact from both cases (best).

r: inner radius
R: outer radius
h: pitch (torus = 0)
n: number of rotations (torus = 1)
